# Contributing

This website contains a personal, reflective piece, and I am not currently accepting any major edits to the text.

However, I am open to suggestions for fixing the content and fully aware that the website's back-end itself could be improved.

If you wish to contribute, please:

- create issues for content-related matters
- create pull requests if you have improved the back-end files (e.g. the HTML/CSS ones)

Thank you.
